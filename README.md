Gwt.Stats
=========

#### Native Google Web Toolkit port of [stats](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js) ####
Just as an addition to [GWT port of three.js](https://github.com/vatula/gwt.threejs). I noticed poor performance of my port and wanted to measure how actually poor it is. Took just a little time so I thought “what the hell” and port that great utility from [mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob). JSNI was not chosen intentionally to keep experiment clean.

#### Usage ####
Please refer to [original utility](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js) from [mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob) for usage. Port uses the same simple API.

#### In Action ####
To see Gwt.Stats in action, please visit [gwt.threejs example “Earth”](http://vatula.github.com/gwt.threejs/examples/canvas_geometry_earth/Globe.html). Original Stats demo can be observed on [original three.js example “Earth”](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/canvas_geometry_earth.html).
